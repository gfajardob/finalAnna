Liberty Bell,"Solemn experience, I did not expect this visit to be an emotional experience but as I read about the history of our country, visualized the excavation of Abraham Lincoln’s homestead an read the narratives of enslaved people. I felt both inspired but sad at the same time knowing my own roots run deeply within the very fabric of this place but so too did the blood and sweat. Truth be told, this was the most American I have ever felt."
Liberty Bell,"I loved visiting the Liberty Bell. It is free to view, just have to stand in a line that moved pretty quickly and then you will find yourself in a small museum that shares some history about the bell and showcases some smaller artifacts."
Liberty Bell,"After walking through the short gallery, you will come upon a beautiful room that features the Liberty Bell framed with a tall glass wall and an unobstructed view of Liberty Hall."
Liberty Bell,The staff was friendly and the process was seamless. You can walk all the way around the bell to take in every detail.
Liberty Bell,"One thing to note is that, though, the bell is free to view anytime, you will need to purchase an advance ticket to tour the inside of Liberty Hall across the street!"
Liberty Bell,The visit to the Liberty Bell was awesome!! There was barely any waiting time!! It was very impressive to see it in real life. I would recommend this place to anyone who goes to Philadelphia for either week or weekends!!
Liberty Bell,"When I came, it was not super busy during a Thursday midday."
Liberty Bell,"I got through security really quickly, and then to see the actual bell, there was not a long line."
Liberty Bell,The Liberty Bell is definitely a must-see and is very nicely preserved.
Liberty Bell,"Not a big history buff, but they did a nice job on telling the story of the bell leading up to the viewing. Probably was more interested in this than other historical interests in town. No ticket, just wait in line."
Liberty Bell,Would be better if it was outside. Its a literal tourist trap. Cant really get too close to look at it without interrupting someones photo. The idea of it is nice. The history is nice. Its just too crowded.
Liberty Bell,"Some history about the Bell. You can also see it from outside through the window. Free. You need to go through security so no big bags, no food, etc. Usually, there is a line outside so consider the weather."
Liberty Bell,"This requires tickets. You can purchase the day you are there or even while standing in front of building. We were there in off season though so availability may differ in summer months. It’s about 45 minutes and you see 2 rooms. Standing only and 4 steps. If you love History, you will enjoy."
Liberty Bell,"I always get mixed feelings when I view stuff like this. I appreciate the fact that they are preserving history, but I don't feel that it's being done respectfully. There's way too much emphasis on the slavery part of it all. From pictures to videos. Constantly pushing the narrative of that's who we are. Consistently showcasing people of color in a negative and destitute state, rather than showing our accomplishments and triumphs, regardless of the attacks that are still presented on us today."
Liberty Bell,I am disappointed in the lack of representation of my people and the whitewashing of history. Downplaying the vicious role that was and is still being orchestrated today by those who created the battle for justice.
Liberty Bell,"It’s cool to see but underwhelming. Thankfully it’s free, so points there!! It’s cool the view of independence hall right in the back but you really don’t spend more than like 5 minutes here. I attached the picture of the bell, that’s basically it y’all. Also they had high security here but the people working there were knowledgeable on Philadelphia history."
Liberty Bell,"The Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is a truly remarkable and historically significant site. Steeped in the rich tapestry of American history, it stands as a powerful symbol of freedom and independence. The experience of witnessing this iconic bell, with its famous crack, is both awe-inspiring and educational. The surrounding exhibits provide a comprehensive understanding of the bell's role in shaping the nation. A visit to the Liberty Bell is a must for anyone seeking a deeper connection to America's past."
Liberty Bell,"The entire Historic District should be explored on foot only. The building in which the Liberty Bell is showcased is nice with a lawn and the experience starts with a history and significance of this great bell and how it was a symbol for liberty and freedom not just for Americans, but for many global situations."
Liberty Bell,"The entire trip at Liberty Bell would take about 40 minutes to an hour, culminating with a few moments at the Bell itself."
Liberty Bell,Your trip to Philadelphia is not complete without this.
Liberty Bell,"Excellent FREE piece of American History to explore. They have lots of plaques inside the visitors center describing how the bell was made, when it rang, where its traveled to, how the crack was formed, and more. Across the street from Independence Hall, close to George Washington’s old home, and right next to the Visitors Center, there’s lots to do in this little area!"
Liberty Bell,"It's neat to see the liberty bell. There were long lines to get in, but they moved quickly. Just watch out for the birds in the rafters if you're standing under them. The beginning of the exhibit is very congested but thins out as you move through. You will need to go through security to get in. It's definitely worth checking out."
Liberty Bell,"This historical location for the US. The line today wasn’t bad about 15 mins. I’ve seen the line as long as 1 hour. You will need to go through metal detector to get in. The agents had no patience for any questions so be prepared. Once inside, they give you so much info about this liberty bell. It will take about 20-30 mins to read through. And on the way out just stop by and take a photo with an actual bell. Fun time."
Liberty Bell,What a piece of history. There is a ton of information as you walk in. Plenty of people working to answer any questions and explain some of the history. He bell is very well taken care of. There are also some remains of Washington's home to view. I'm glad we are still able to view such an important piece of American history.
Liberty Bell,"short line, not particularly busy, weather was perfect."
Liberty Bell,"I love the preservation of history! It was equally viewable all the way around. Plenty to read and look at while standing in line to see the bell itself! Make the time, I was in and out in less than 30 minutes. There was not much of a line at all. Total time in and out was less than an hour."
City Hall,"Amazing views from the top. We had limited time in Philadelphia, so going up the tower gave us great city views quickly. The staff were nice and helpful. Tickets were about $12. The elevator is quite old and small, so only 4 people can go up at a time. If you're claustrophobic, this might not be for you. Once up there, you've got 15 minutes. Worth it and would recommend."
City Hall,"Great Tour! This review is for the 'City Hall Interior & Exterior with Tower Tour', which was a 90-minute guided tour and 30 minutes to go up to see the views from the tower. As others have noted, the elevator up to the tower is tiny, so there was a good amount of wait time to get the whole tour group up and down."
City Hall,"Worth the small price for the shorter tour that is longer than they tell you! We weren’t sure what the tour encompassed; however, we paid for the short tour and donated to the restoration fund. Our tour guide was very informative and genuine. We were taken through security and up to a higher floor and a waiting room. Four people of our group were invited into an elevator that we realized was going up in the tower."
City Hall,"I took my grandson on the tour to the top of Philadelphia's City Hall, and I would recommend it. It was not expensive, $10 last summer, and you get a great view of the city from atop this beautiful building. It's cool just to go in the building, climb the massive stairways. While waiting for the final ascent, you can brush up on City Hall history by reading interesting displays with large photos. We liked it!"
City Hall,"We absolutely loved our City Hall tour and visit up the tower. The views from the top are incredible, and the statue of William Penn is so detailed it’s amazing to think all that detail is wasted as you can’t see any of that from the bottom. We really enjoyed the history brief given by our tour guide, and thankfully there were only 6 of us on the tour, so it was very personal."
City Hall,One of the best tours I have been on! Our tour guide was knowledgeable and funny. The history is amazing. The view from the top was also beautiful. We also got to learn a lot about the history and architecture of the building. I highly recommend this tour.
City Hall,It's a short tour up to the top. It's worth it if you have some extra time in Philadelphia. The views from the top of City Hall are beautiful and well worth the time.
City Hall,This was an amazing historical experience! The tour guide was fantastic. The views from the top of City Hall were amazing. And it was great to hear the history about the building. Highly recommend this tour!
City Hall,"Really enjoyed the tour, especially the views from the tower. The elevator ride up is cramped, but it's quick, and the view from the top is worth the wait!"

Elfreth's Alley,"Elfreth’s Alley is a beautiful and historic street in Philadelphia. The street is lined with 18th-century homes and has a unique charm. The cobblestone street adds to the ambiance, and the atmosphere is calm and picturesque. It's a great place to stroll and learn about the history of the area. Highly recommend it if you’re in the area."
Elfreth's Alley,"This street has great character. It’s quiet and peaceful, and the historic homes are beautiful. I loved walking down the alley and imagining what life was like back in the 18th century. There’s also a small museum that gives you more context on the history of the area. Highly recommend it."

The alley is lined with charming, old houses, and there’s a small museum on-site that offers more information on the history of the area. Definitely worth a visit."
